INDUS ACTION is founded and managed by a team of Indian students at Harvard University who are committed to contributing towards the growth and development of India. The team’s strengths include both extensive experience across a diverse range of functions and sectors (government, education, agriculture, healthcare, entrepreneurship, manufacturing, corporate strategy) as well as deep professional and alumni networks representing India’s best universities, companies and NGOs. We currently will be operating out of Boston and Delhi chapters.
